Let's use branching for feature PRs and maybe we'll protect the master branch more formally in a few days. <3 <3 <3 ~The Management

## Developer Notes:

* Because this is running Rails 4.2.5, anyone running a vagrant dev env will have to run `rails s -b 0.0.0.0` in order to browse to the App at `http://localhost:3030/`
* 
* Skipping a build in Travis CI: add `[ci skip]` to the git commit message. Commits that have `[ci skip]` anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI.
